# XML_Files_Comparator

## Features

- XMLUnit library
- BufferReader to read the xml files in an optimized way

## Use case

- XMLUnit can be a good alternative to Beyond Compare for specific use cases, particularly when you need to programmatically compare and analyze XML files within a software application or script. XMLUnit is a Java- 
  based library that provides functionalities for comparing XML documents, validating against schemas, and asserting XML structures in unit tests.

- While Beyond Compare is a standalone visual file and directory comparison tool that supports various file formats, XMLUnit is more focused on XML-specific comparisons and assertions within a programming 
  environment.

## Consider using XMLUnit when:

Automation: You want to integrate XML comparison into an automated process or script.

Testing: You need XML comparison functionalities for unit testing purposes.

Programmatic Access: You prefer a programmatic approach to XML comparison within your Java-based application.
